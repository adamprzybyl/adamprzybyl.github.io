<p>Adam Przybyl</p>
<p>Fact-checker, editor, writer. I’ve spent the last four years volunteering and working at South Side Weekly and fact-checking for the Atavist Magazine, the Marshall Project, Rest of World, and others.</p>
<p>I am looking for freelance and full-time fact-checking, editing, and writing opportunities. Based in Chicago, open to remote work.</p>
<h1 id="snapshot">Snapshot</h1>
<p>A brief rundown of what I do and some examples of my work.</p>
<h2 id="fact-checking">Fact-checking</h2>
<p>I have experience fact-checking articles, essays, reviews, and books. I’ve worked with heavy subjects like police brutality, sexual abuse, death, chronic illness, and climate change. I’ve tackled stories as long as 15,000 words, with anonymous and protected sources, and set in every continent (minus Antarctica). I’m comfortable checking and researching subjects like immigration, prisons and policing, US courts and law, business, and science (especially plant and animal biology, neuroscience and climate science).</p>
<h3 id="the-marshall-project">The Marshall Project</h3>
<p>I fact-check the weekly series <em>Life Inside</em> which features essays by currently and formerly incarcerated people, and others involved with US courts and prisons.</p>
<h4 id="flint-water"><a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/09/12/a-thirst-for-justice">Flint Water</a></h4>
<p>The writer stayed at Genessee County jail in Flint during the water crisis and detailed miserable conditions and negligence. The public information officer tried to deny these conditions and downplayed the veracity and relevance of several lawsuits accusing jail officials of abuse.</p>
<h4 id="tennessee-death-row"><a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/03/05/my-cell-in-solitary-has-a-view-the-death-house">Tennessee Death Row</a></h4>
<p>The writer witnessed an execution at Riverbend Maximum Security in Nashville through his cell window. I dug deep to find blueprints of the execution chamber and used Google Earth to verify that his descriptions of the execution were plausible.</p>
<h4 id="covid-in-washington"><a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/28/in-prison-even-social-distancing-rules-get-weaponized">COVID in Washington</a></h4>
<p>The writer, a frequent contributor for Life Inside, claimed that officials at Washington State Reformatory selectively used COVID justifications to punish and abuse prisoners. The DOC pushed back hard but were unable to justify or refute most of the important points.</p>
<h4 id="cant-breathe-in-prison"><a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/07/23/all-of-us-inside-have-cried-out">Can’t Breathe in Prison</a></h4>
<p>The writer described two incidents at Washington State Reformatory in which guards attacked prisoners and performed chokeholds, tying it into the killing of George Floyd a few weeks earlier. I had to cross-check the incidents with several prisoners for a complete and accurate picture of events.</p>
<h3 id="the-atavist-magazine">The Atavist Magazine</h3>
<p>The Atavist’s stories run very long (8,000-15,000 words) and feature in-depth reporting, historical research, and powerful storytelling.</p>
<h4 id="porambo"><a href="https://magazine.atavist.com/ron-porambo-newark-riots-police-violence">Porambo</a></h4>
<p>This 15,000 word story chronicles the life of Ronald Porambo, a fiercely confrontational and creative journalist who wrote “No Cause for Indictment,” a searing investigation into the deaths of 26 people during the Newark riots of 1968. The writer relied on extensive interviews with family members and former colleagues, along with police records and archives, to piece together a compelling narrative.</p>
<h4 id="hong-kong"><a href="https://magazine.atavist.com/do-you-hear-the-people-sing-hong-kong-democracy-protests-china">Hong Kong</a></h4>
<p>This piece tells the story of Hong Kong’s 2019 protests through the eyes of protestors who fought police, set up blockades, and helped comrades, culminating in the siege of HK Polytechnic University in November 2019. Due to China’s crackdown on the movement, all the sources were anonymized and I had to be extra careful when contacting them and verifying their stories, so as not to leak any identifying information.</p>
<h4 id="butterflies"><a href="https://magazine.atavist.com/long-may-they-reign-monarch-butterfly-climate-change-california-migration">Butterflies</a></h4>
<p>The unlikely main character of this story is a Monarch butterfly, raised by people in Oregon, that makes its trek across the Sierra Nevada to the winter nesting sites on the southern coast of California. The writer speaks with lepidopterists, wildlife conservatists, Monarch enthusiasts, and tour guides to figure out how climate change and human activity have led to a declining Monarch population, what can be done to help, and the disagreements within the Monarch expert community.</p>
<h4 id="makoko"><a href="https://magazine.atavist.com/things-fall-apart-makoko-floating-school">Makoko</a></h4>
<p>The first story I fact-checked for the Atavist was a deep dive into the promises and failures of a floating school in Makoko, a poor fishing village in Lagos built on a lagoon. The architects, government officials, local leaders and international media fought for different narratives around the school, which meant a lot of cross-checking and sorting out of what actually happened and in what order.</p>
<h3 id="vice">VICE</h3>
<p>My first and longest freelance gig. Before VICE transitioned to a quarterly anthology magazine, they had a monthly print magazine with interesting and often deeply-reported features.</p>
<h4 id="greece-refugees"><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/8qew7k/how-greece-became-the-eus-prison-for-refugees-v24n2">Greece Refugees</a></h4>
<p>This story followed the plight of Syrian and other refugees as they waited for asylum decisions in miserable camps on Greek islands, and where they went in Athens once through. One of the first major features I ever checked, I had to verify a lot of prickly details with refugees, NGO workers, legal analysts and activists residing in Exarchia.</p>
<h4 id="long-island-ms13"><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vb4qdb/murder-in-the-suburbs-v24n5">Long Island MS13</a></h4>
<p>Set against the tragic backdrop of the murder of a high school girl, this story grappled with how US deportations had fed the growth of El Salvadoran gang MS13, how it established a foothold on Long Island, and the different strategies employed by police and activists to fight it.</p>
<h4 id="drugs"><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xp8g4/the-psychedelic-resistance-v25n4">Drugs</a></h4>
<p>This feature examined changing trends in psychedelic use and wove together experiences of many people from around the world to suggest that the pressures of 21st-century capitalism are nudging workers to escape and unwind in new ways.</p>
<h4 id="crispr"><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/kz49ge/this-gene-technology-could-change-the-world-its-maker-isnt-sure-it-should-v26n4">CRISPR</a></h4>
<p>This story dove into using CRISPR gene-editing technology to setup a ‘gene drive’ that spreads through a population, changing its genetic structure, and debates between its inventor and others for whether it should ever be used.</p>
